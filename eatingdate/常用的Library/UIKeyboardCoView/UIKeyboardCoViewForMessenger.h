/**
	This class is a subclass of UIView that stays on top of the keyboard. For best results, the view in the XIB should be HIDDEN at first.
 
 In order for this view to work correctly with rotation, the ROOT view controller has to post the UIKeyboardCoViewWillRotateNotification and UIKeyboardCoViewDidRotateNotification in the willRotateToInterfaceOrientation and didRotateFromInterfaceOrientation respectively. Like so:
 
 - (void) willRotateToInterfaceOrientation:(UIInterfaceOrientation)toInterfaceOrientation duration:(NSTimeInterval)duration{
 [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] postNotificationName:UIKeyboardCoViewWillRotateNotification object:nil];
 }
 
 - (void) didRotateFromInterfaceOrientation:(UIInterfaceOrientation)fromInterfaceOrientation{
 [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] postNotificationName:UIKeyboardCoViewDidRotateNotification object:nil];
 }
